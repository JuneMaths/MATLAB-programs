# [Program 1: Tangent to the circle](https://github.com/JuneMaths/MATLAB-programs/blob/main/Styczna_do_okregu_z_punktu.m)
The program draws a tangent to a circle with any given initial parameters (circle center O(x0,y0) and radius R) from any initial point P(x1,y1)

# [Program 2: Tangent plane to a three-dimensional function](https://github.com/JuneMaths/MATLAB-programs/blob/main/Plaszczyzna_funkcji.m)
The program draws tangent plane to a function of two variables passed as an anonymous function. It is the first argument of the function. The second argument is a metod of drawing the function. It can be drawn in a circle or a rectangle. The third argument is a list of necessary data for that method. The last argument is a list of point values from the function for which we want to draw a tangent plane.
